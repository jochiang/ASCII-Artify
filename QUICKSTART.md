# Quick Start Guide

## Getting Started in 30 Seconds

1. **Open the application**
   - Simply open `index.html` in your web browser
   - No server required - it runs entirely in your browser!

2. **Upload an image**
   - Click the drop zone in the center of the page
   - Or drag and drop an image file onto the drop zone
   - Supported formats: JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP

3. **Convert to ASCII**
   - Click the "Convert to ASCII" button
   - Your ASCII art will appear in the preview area

4. **Adjust settings (optional)**
   - **ASCII Width**: Use the slider to make the ASCII art wider or narrower (20-300 characters)
   - **Character Set**: Change the characters used for the ASCII art (default: ` .:-=+*#%@`)
   - The preview updates automatically when you change settings

5. **Export your creation**
   - Click "Export as PNG" to save as an image file
   - Click "Export as Text" to save as a plain text file

## Tips for Best Results

- **Image Selection**: Images with high contrast work best
- **ASCII Width**:
  - 50-100: Good for portraits and detailed images
  - 100-150: Great for landscapes
  - 150+: Very detailed, but slower to render
- **Character Set**:
  - Fewer characters = simpler, bolder look
  - More characters = more detail and gradation
  - Example simple set: ` .#`
  - Example detailed set: ` .',:;clodxkO0KXNWM`

## Troubleshooting

**Image won't upload:**
- Make sure it's a supported format (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
- Check that the file is under 10MB

**Conversion is slow:**
- Reduce the ASCII width
- Try a smaller image

**ASCII art looks wrong:**
- Try adjusting the character set
- Increase the ASCII width for more detail

## What's Next?

This is Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the full implementation. Future phases will add:
- Video to ASCII conversion
- Color ASCII art
- Real-time processing with Web Workers
- Custom conversion algorithms
- And more!

Enjoy creating ASCII art! 🎨
